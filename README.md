# Basic-Portfolio

Stuff to fix

-find out why contact/portfolio pages size differently
- way way way too much css - need to consolodate
- add content to portfolio instead of placeholder
- add some real text
- style nav links better
--get content to display correctly - body flex for sticky footer seems to be doing this, research how to just push the content down and not flex the entire body

- get styling to work after using reset
